## Description

Wacław Sierpiński was a Polish Mathematician for whom the Sierpinski Triangle is named for. The Sierpinski triangle is the result of placing a dot within a triangle, and if successive dots are drawn, each one at the halfway point between the previous dot and a random vertex of the triangle. When this process is repeated enough times, really cool stuff starts to happen. This simple simulation run the Sierpinski Triangle pattern for 10,000 iterations and renders the pattern on the page.
